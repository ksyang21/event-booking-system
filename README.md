# Event Booking System

#### Developed by : JC

I am using this project to learn about Laravel, Inertia.js, Docker, and Git after so many years of writing native PHP 
and jQuery.

#### Requirements : 

- Users should be able to register and log in to the system.
- Users should be able to create, view, update, and delete events.
- Events should have attributes such as title, description, date, time, location, and capacity.
- Users should be able to search for events based on different criteria (e.g., title, date, location).
- Users should have a dashboard to view and manage their booked events.

#### Tech Used :

- Laravel
- WSL
- Inertia.js (Vue 3)
- Docker
- MySQL
- Git
